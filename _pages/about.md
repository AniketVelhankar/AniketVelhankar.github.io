About Me
======

Hi!, I am Aniket, a final year Undergraduate student in Computer Science at [Pune Institute of Computer Technology [P.I.C.T], Pune](https://pict.edu). 

My research interests lie at an intersection of deep learning and computer vision. I want to bridge the gap between research and application to use innovative research ideas in solving real life problems.

Currently, I am working as an R&D Intern with [NICE Ltd.](https://www.nice.com/pune/) to develop a POC involving cross-platform mobile development. Previously, I have worked as an R&D Intern at [OrbitShifters Inc.](https://www.orbitshifters.com/), where I was involved in developing solutions to derive analytics from combat sports like boxing, taekwondo, karate, etc. I have worked with [VEM Tooling Group](https://www.vem-tooling.com/) on a consultancy project titled 'Automatic dimension extraction from 3D objects using computer vision and image processing'.

I am involved in research activities at my institute, currently working with Dr. S. A. Joshi, at the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning [(CAIDL)](https://pict.edu/caidl/) lab, P.I.C.T. for UG thesis. Earlier, I have worked with Dr. R. B. Ingle, researching dimension extraction from 3D objects, and Dr. G. V. Kale researching skin disease diagnosis using deep learning.

I have been selected for SIH finals twice, working on problem statements by ISRO and DRDO. My team secured a rank in the top 15 contestants for the CDAC AI hackathon and in the top 5  contestants for the IIT Madras data science competition. 

I am always looking for challenging problems in applied research and apply my problem-solving skills to solve socially relevant problems and build real-world applications.
