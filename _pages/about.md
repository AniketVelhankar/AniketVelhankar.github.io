About Me
======

Hi!, I am Aniket, a final year Undergraduate student in Computer Science at [Pune Institute of Computer Technology [P.I.C.T], Pune](https://pict.edu). 

My research interests lie at an intersection of deep learning and computer vision. I want to bridge the gap between research and application to use innovative research ideas in solving real life problems. 

I am always looking for challenging problems in applied research and apply my problem-solving skills to solve socially relevant problems and build real-world applications.
